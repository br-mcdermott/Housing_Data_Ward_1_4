## Housing_Data_Ward_1_4

This is a project to assist the Greater Columbia Heights Faith Coalition for Affordable Housing measure, monitor and support affordable housing in Wards 1 and 4 of Washington, District of Columbia, USA.  

Stage 1 of this project is to create a database listing all residential units in Wards 1 and 4 using data available from [Open Data DC] (http://opendata.dc.gov/) and then to identify which of these are, or might be, under some regulation to promote affordability (rent stabilization, section 8, tax incentives).  In stage one we will build on the work already done by the [Code for DC rent stabilization project] (https://github.com/codefordc/rent-stabilization) and collaborate with the [Code for DC housing- insights project] (https://github.com/codefordc/housing-insights)
