# Housing_Data_Ward_1_4

This is a project to assist the Greater Columbia Heights Faith Coalition for Affordable Housing  (GCHFCAH) measure, monitor and support affordable housing in Wards 1 and 4 of Washington, District of Columbia, USA.  

**Stage 1** of this project is to create a database listing all residential units in Wards 1 and 4 using data available from [Open Data DC] (http://opendata.dc.gov/) and then to identify which of these are, or might be, under some regulation to promote affordability (rent stabilization, section 8, tax incentives).  In stage one we will build on the work already done by the [Code for DC rent stabilization project] (https://github.com/codefordc/rent-stabilization) and collaborate with the [Code for DC housing- insights project] (https://github.com/codefordc/housing-insights)

**Stage 2** of this project is to ground-truth our data in selected blocks within Wards 1 and 4.  We have yet to work out the methodology for this but the objective is to have members of the GCHFCAH walk the given blocks and compare what they see on the ground to what is in our database.  Also they will check with Web searches and phone calls to check variables like the number of units in a multi-family building. We hope to establish the accuracy of our database.  I regard this as the essential contribution of this project to the other housing data projects in DC.  By working on a subset of locations and data in DC we are able to do some physical checks on the data and identify strengths and weaknesses in our data sources.

**Stage 3** done in collaboration with [Code for DC housing- insights project] (https://github.com/codefordc/housing-insights) will be to see how we can use this database to assist our promotion of affordable housing in Wards 1 and 4 by
* record increase/loss of affordable housing units over time
* recongnize as early as possible when affordable housing units are under direct threat
* predict which buildings are likely to be targetted for re-development or other potential loss of affordable units
* identify areas/building with good potential for redevelopment as multi-income level developments.
